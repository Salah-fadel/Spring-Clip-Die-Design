# Spring-Clip-Die-Design
Educational project focused on progressive die design for a Spring Clip, modeled in SolidWorks. 

📌 Important Note:
> Please refer to the attached PDF file included in this repository, titled : "ملاحظات فنية و توضيحات منهجية حول تصميم إسطمبة لإنتاج Spring Clip"
This document contains highly valuable technical notes that explain the design decisions, challenges encountered during the project, and the engineering alternatives that were considered.
It is strongly recommended to review this file for a deeper understanding of the project background, especially the aspects that were not implemented at this stage—such as advanced bending operations and shank position calculations.
